Ultima VI schedule file:
------------------------

## Nuvie <http://nuvie.sourceforge.net>
## Doc Written By: Eric Fry <efry @t users sourceforge net>


This file contains the schedules for the 256 NPCs in Ultima6. It takes the 
following format.

The first 0x200 bytes comprise the 256 offsets (uint16) to the start of each 
NPC's schedule info. Offsets relative to the address 0x202.

The two bytes starting at 0x200 are the total number of schedule entries in the 
file.

The rest of the file from 0x202 onwards contains the actual schedule entries.
Each entry is 5 bytes long and has the following structure.

struct schedule_entry {
uint8 start_hour,
uint8 worktype,
uint8 position1,
uint8 position2,
uint8 position3
};

start_hour:  In 24 hour format, this indicates when the current entry should 
             start. Schedule entries are in assending order based on 
             start_hour.

worktype: This value controls what actions are preformed by the NPC for the
          current schedule entry. A list of possible worktype codes is provided
          below.

position1..3: The 3 position bytes describe the NPCs position in packed x,y,z
              notation.

              x [10 bits]
              y [10 bits]
              z [4 bits]
